Each Captain Cut is special and requires the allotted time to complete. This is why we keep a strict policy around our appointments and their cancellation times. If for some reason you need to cancel, we totally understand – we just need time to make adequate adjustments in our team’s schedules.

Please read below for more details surrounding our policy.

We must receive your cancellation 12 hours before your appointment.
If we are not contacted prior to the 12-hour window, we will be forced to include a 50% CHARGE ON YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT.
If you are within the 12-hour window; you can contact us anytime at:

Primary Phone: 519-731-3819

Please understand that as a professional-quality service we only enforce this policy to ensure every single cut gets the attention it deserves.

Thank you
