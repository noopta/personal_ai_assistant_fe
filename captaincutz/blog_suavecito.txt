Why choose Suavecito products?
Sauvecito Pomade is an amazing new water-based pomade that is soft and has a nice creamy texture. It’s easy to put in, easy to wash out and is easily restyled with a comb or brush. This product contains great oils that leave your hair and scalp healthy while providing you with a beautiful shine. It also doesn’t flake, which means no more embarrassing flakes stuck on your collar.
