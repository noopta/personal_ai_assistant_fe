 ok perfect. here's one more thing. I think we should return the relevant emails always - regardless of
 if theyre a meeting related email or not. Again, the ones related to the text streamed response not all
 emails always. The difference is for the meeting related ones on our front end, we will add a badge to 
the meeting related emails and no badge for non meeting related emails. So for example if someone asks 
about their bills we should still show the card on our front end for the relevant results found, but for
 a meeting related email it should be different. that brings me to my next thought, which is in our JSON
 response we can send back how we currently are, but instead of meeting_emails we can call it 
relevant_emails, and add a key indiciating if its meeting related or not based on the pre-processing 
we've already done. Does that make sense? dont make acny changes uet 

● Yes, that makes perfect sense! Let me break down what you're asking for:

  Current Behavior:

  - meeting_emails array only contains emails with Event nodes (meeting-related)
  - Non-meeting emails mentioned in the response are NOT returned as cards

  Desired Behavior:

  - Rename meeting_emails → relevant_emails
  - Include ALL emails mentioned in the streamed response (both meeting and non-meeting)
  - Add a boolean field like isMeeting: true/false or keep eventRelated: true/false
  - Frontend will:
    - Show badge for eventRelated: true emails
    - Show plain card for eventRelated: false emails

  Example Response:

  {
    "complete": true,
    "relevant_emails": [
      {
        "id": "msg_sample_1",
        "subject": "Weekly Standup",
        "from": {...},
        "eventRelated": true,        // ← Has badge
        "eventType": "standup",
        "confidence": 0.9
      },
      {
        "id": "msg_sample_5",
        "subject": "Your bill is ready",
        "from": {...},
        "eventRelated": false,       // ← No badge
        "eventType": null,
        "confidence": null
      }
    ]
  }

  This way:
  - Bills query → returns bill email cards (no badges)
  - Meetings query → returns meeting email cards (with badges)
  - Mixed query → returns both types with appropriate badges

  Should I proceed with this implementation?
