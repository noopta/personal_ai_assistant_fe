## **16. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

### **16.1 Informal Dispute Resolution**

**Before initiating arbitration or litigation, you agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute informally by:**

1. Sending a written notice to anuptaislam33@gmail.com describing:
   - The nature of the dispute
   - The relief you seek
   - Your contact information

2. Engaging in good-faith negotiations for at least **30 days**

**If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days, either party may initiate arbitration.**

### **16.2 Binding Arbitration**

**You and AirThreads agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, rather than in court, except as set forth below.**

**Arbitration Rules:**
- Arbitration will be conducted by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** under its **Consumer Arbitration Rules** (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org))
- The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator
- The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding
- Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction

**Location:**
- Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence, or via telephone/video conference if mutually agreed

**Costs:**
- Each party will bear their own costs and attorneys' fees, unless the arbitrator awards fees to the prevailing party as permitted by law
- If your claim is for less than $10,000, we will reimburse AAA filing fees and pay arbitrator fees (you pay your own attorneys' fees unless you prevail and are awarded fees)

### **16.3 Class Action Waiver**

**YOU AND AIRTHREADS AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION.**

- You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration
- The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or conduct class arbitrations
- The arbitrator may award relief only to individual parties

**IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THE ENTIRE ARBITRATION PROVISION (SECTION 16.2) SHALL BE VOID, AND DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED IN COURT.**

### **16.4 Exceptions to Arbitration**

The following disputes are **not subject to arbitration** and may be brought in court:

1. **Small Claims Court:** Disputes within the jurisdiction of small claims court may be brought there instead of arbitration
2. **Injunctive Relief:** Claims seeking injunctive or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement or misuse of the Service
3. **Opt-Out:** If you opt out of arbitration (see Section 16.5)

### **16.5 Opt-Out Right**

**You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to anuptaislam33@gmail.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.**

Your opt-out notice must include:
- Your name and email address
- A statement that you opt out of the arbitration agreement

**If you opt out, you and AirThreads will resolve disputes through litigation (subject to Section 17).**

### **16.6 Future Changes**

If we make material changes to this arbitration provision (other than changes to the notice address), you may reject the changes by sending written notice within 30 days of the change. Rejection constitutes opt-out under Section 16.5.
