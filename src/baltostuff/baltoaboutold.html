<p dir="ltr"><span>We’re a family from Toronto with a big-hearted German Shepherd named Balto. Like most dogs, Balto lives for treats—but not just any treat. His absolute favourite? Freeze-dried chicken hearts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We started noticing it was getting tough to find freeze-dried chicken hearts in stores around Toronto. And when we did find them, they were almost always made in the U.S.—not here in Canada. That didn’t sit right with us. We wanted something local, something we could trust, and something Balto would go crazy for.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So, we decided to make it ourselves.</span></p>
